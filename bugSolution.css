The solution involves restructuring the CSS to ensure the desired specificity is achieved, avoiding reliance on ID selectors where possible:

```css
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}

#myElement {
  color: red;
}

/* Solution: use a more specific class or move the rule */
.myClass.override {
  color: green;
}
```

Alternatively, if it's absolutely necessary to apply styles based on an ID, the specificity can be managed by strategically using other selectors (such as attributes) to add to the overall specificity.  This approach should be used with caution as over-reliance on high specificity can make CSS difficult to maintain.

Remember that the most specific selector in the cascading rules will always win.  Understanding the order of specificity is key to avoiding this type of unexpected behavior.

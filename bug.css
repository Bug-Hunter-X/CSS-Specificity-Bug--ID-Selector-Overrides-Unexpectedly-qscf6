The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The unexpected behavior occurs because the ID selector (`#myElement`) has higher specificity than the class selector (`.myClass`), causing the style defined for `#myElement` to override the style for `.myClass` even though `.myClass` is declared later.

```css
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}

#myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green; /* This rule is expected to override both the others but doesn't */
}
```

The expected behavior might be that `#myElement.myClass` has the highest specificity and thus should result in green text. However, due to how specificity works in CSS, the ID selector always wins, and this rule does not override.
